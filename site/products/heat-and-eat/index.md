Trying to get the perfect taste of Louisiana but don't feel like preparing it yourself? We've definitely got you covered. All of our heat and eat meals and sides are fully cooked, ready to be heated up and served. Our boiler bags make it even easier for you. Simply place the whole bag into boiling water for 15 mins, cut open, and serve!
